It’s no secret that tech has successfully permeated every aspect of human existence – it’s in our cars, our homes, hell, even our dog collars. It’s completely ubiquitous. Because of this, most non-tech companies, regardless of product or industry, have realized that advancing their tech is mission critical to long term relevance. They have also realized it’s important that people KNOW they are advancing… Hence that catchy PR buzz-phrase “We’re not a \_\_\_\_ company, we’re a tech company.”

Being a Detroit native, the first \_\_\_\_ company that comes to mind is Rocket Mortgage. Going back to their 2016 Super Bowl commercial (Push Button, Get Mortgage), the company formerly known as Quicken has been strategically rebranding itself as a tech-first finance company. Of course, it’s not purely a rebrand - their product has evolved considerably alongside the branding. They walk the tech-walk with crispy UI interfaces, advanced CRMs, and Plaid integrations during underwriting.

But don’t get it twisted - their product is not technology. At its core, Rocket is still a mortgage origination and servicing company. What they have done is leverage technology to transform the customer experience and dramatically scale the capabilities of their very human workforce. This evolution has helped cement them atop the leaderboard as the largest mortgage originator in the country (by a healthy margin).

What Rocket and other companies seem to understand about tech evolution, many people fail to understand where they need to evolve as well. As tech continues permeating every aspect of our lives, employees should be thinking about how their own professional skill set is keeping pace. To paraphrase Ashton Kutcher (Michael Kelso turned seasoned tech investor), eventually we will reach a point where there are two kinds of employees, those that tell robots what to do and those that are told what to do by robots. Personally, I would rather be the former.

In a lot of ways, I’ve been able to break free from the traditional accountant’s mold because I have always emphasized technology at each stage of my career. Going back to my early days as a Deloitte auditor, I differentiated myself by always bringing a tech forward mindset (likely a result of being painfully bored all the time). Because I was able to utilize data analytics and basic automation in my projects, I was afforded opportunities way outside the average duties of a ‘Big 4 auditor’. I participated in national innovation labs, massive firm-wide software developments, and ultimately landed an advisory role helping to build a new finance transformation service offering.

Those experiences eventually led me to a seed stage Fin-Tech where I was tasked with building accounting and finance infrastructure as the company grew to 100+ employees and a 9-figure valuation. Over time, I got tired of the start-up grind and jumped ship for a wonderful offer with an iconic tech-company (a true tech company, not a \_\_\_\_ company). They needed a controller that could also build scalable financial systems, which was a perfect match for my skill set.

When I tell people I’m a CPA, most people just assume I do taxes and their eyes glaze over at the mere thought of learning more. If there is genuine interest, I sometimes go deeper and explain the true nature of my trade. At this point in my career, accounting is like 20% of what I do. The other 80% is business process consulting, systems engineering, software implementation, product management, data analytics, and IT troubleshooting. These non-accounting skill sets have allowed me to broaden my professional experiences and significantly enhanced my earning potential.

So, with that said, I pose this question to the non-developer professionals out there. As analysts, lawyers, project managers, etc. - how is your own digital skillset evolving? Is your tech acumen evolving alongside your employer in order to stay relevant? If this is old news and you already know how to code python, great – you are way ahead of many professionals. If this has got you thinking – here are some easy suggestions for how you can start to expand your own skill set right away.

* Familiarize yourself with latest and greatest software in your field/industry
* Learn what APIs are and how they can link software/databases together
* Understand the different record types in databases that you use regularly
* Understand how key fields are shared between record types and how these fields initiate action
* Identify ways to automate repetitive tasks performed by you and your peers
* Learn how to link data from different sources and use Power BI or PivotTables to analyze that data
