Growing up I always wanted to be an architect. My mother is an artist and my father works in construction. I wanted to blend the two together and I thought it would be fun, I liked to draw. My skills in drawing faded as quick as my interest when my dad brought home our first computer. It ran Windows 95 and I thought it was *the*  coolest thing ever. I was fascinated and since I loved video games my parents got me some to play on the PC. As the years went by my love for games grew/ I remember coming home to play World of Warcraft after school and playing until my home work was due the next day. I loved it. 

My first love was video games but, I quickly found another with music. I never played an instrument but, it mostly listening and dissecting lyrics. 

High school came and went with plenty of woes, highs and all the in between and I had to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. A big burden to put on the shoulders of a seventeen year old, or anyone for that matter. I had no idea. I thought some with electronic hardware would be cool. 

With my poor grades and lack of direction I decided to go a local community college. For electrical engineering, then electronic technologist, then bio medical technology. I didn't really like any of them (I mean they are all very similar). After a little break from school. I had a brilliant idea. I would do something similar to what I wanted when I was young.
