Growing up I always wanted to be an architect. My mother is an artist and my father works in construction. I wanted to blend the two together, I thought it would be fun, and I liked to draw. My skills in drawing faded as quick as my interest when my dad brought home our first computer. It ran Windows 95 and I thought it was *the*  coolest thing ever. I was fascinated and since I loved video games my parents bought some for me play on the PC. As the years went by my love for games grew. I remember coming home to play World of Warcraft after school and playing until my home work was due the next day. I loved it. 

My first love was video games but, I quickly found another with music. I never played an instrument but, it mostly listening and dissecting lyrics. Feeling the emotion of some through music really meant a lot to me. 

High school came and went with plenty of woes, highs and all the in between and I had to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. A big burden to put on the shoulders of a seventeen year old, or anyone for that matter. I had no idea. I thought some with electronic hardware would be cool. 

With my poor grades and lack of direction I decided to go a local community college. For electrical engineering, then electronic technologist, then bio medical technology. I didn't really like any of them (I mean they are all very similar). After a little break from school. I had a brilliant idea. I would do something similar to what I wanted when I was young.

I was going to be a music producer/recording engineer.  I mean I have a great understanding of computers and I love music. This was it. *This* was what I was going to do. I realized after a short while that it wasn't. In the words of my favorite professor at the school, "You have to be in the wrong place at the wrong time a thousand times before you are in the right place at the right time to make it in music."\

When I first heard that I thought, "That's cool, I'll do that. No problem, I want this." The only thing was I didn't realize how few and far between each of those times are. I gave up. I couldn't do it anymore. I took quite the break and worked a few dead end jobs. They paid alright and living at my parents was that bad but, I had bigger dreams than that. I wanted more. I wanted a lot more. 

After a few years of job jumping I decided I would go back to school. It was a big decision to do that, it was scary I was comfortable with what I had. I knew it would be tech and after a quick stint of networking, I found programing. It was love at first byte. The first program that I got to work was the coolest thing. It was such a rush. Regardless, I found it, this **was** it. This was the thing I was going to do for the rest of my life.

Before I graduated I found and internship as a Full stack developer and learn so much. I worked hard there and they thought so too, they hired me and I spent a decent time there. I have moved on from them and have another job. I am working on my own stuff as well. I love it though. There is always something new, something to learn, and I still get that rush once in a while when something finally works.

I spent so much time searching but, I never gave up and I think that is the most important thing. Never give up. Even if you don't know what you would be giving up or what the future holds don't stop chasing what you want.
